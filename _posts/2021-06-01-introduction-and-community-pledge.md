# Community Pledge
We the VSec community pledge to aim to be a community for the community and doing this by uniting all security interested while respecting that all humans are equal. Participants in the VSec community are expected to act according toa Code of Conduct to make sure that everybody feels included and welcome in our community. 

## English as publishing language
We have chosen English as the main language for our website and public community contributions (projects, blogs) since they might be valuable by are broader audience than VSec. Community events on the other hand could be held both in Danish and/or English.

## Leadership and rules
VSec is run by a community board that consists of one or more members from each larger community group in Denmark but with the possibility for the founder to enforce veto on decisions that might contradict the community pledge and purpose of VSec.
