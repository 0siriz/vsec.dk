Want to do a online non-profit event on the VSec Discord server and get the support of the growing Danish InfoSec community, feel free to reach out to us on Discord. As an option we can also help provide a semi-professional setup by live re-streaming the event on other streaming services like our [VSec YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGQCK473y181BjNMJLrW11g) etc.

## Streaming Guide

If you want to have your event broadcasted live and recorded on the [VSec YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGQCK473y181BjNMJLrW11g) please reach to @kbodeholt on Discord.

How to stream from Discord to YouTube or other streaming services on behalf of VSec
1. Coordinate date/time for a streamer to be online to stream the event on behalf the community group
2. Send the streamkey for the streaming service to the streamer
3. Have fun!!
