# Blog

Blog posts are stored in the [/data/blog](/data/blog) directory and are written in [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), with [YML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) at the top for metadata. The `title`, `author`, and `date` properties should be set on all posts.

See this guide for further information: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

**Example post**

```markdown

/blog index page

## Guidelines to keep in mind when publishing a blog

- Posts must be related to Information Security and be relevant to either the VSec members or general public.
- Posts that include material from and/or links to commercial parties must be limited as much as possible.  
  Please consider open source alternatives.
- Posts are reviewed by the VSec Community Board and might be discarded.  
  Remember quality content is more valuable than quantity. 
- Make sure the date in the filename is today's date + name (1999-12-31-topic.md).
