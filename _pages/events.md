Want to do a online non-profit event on the VSec Discord server and get the support of the growing Danish InfoSec community, feel free to reach out to @kbodeholt on Discord. As an option we can also help provide a semi-professional setup by live re-streaming the event on other streaming services (YouTube VSec Channel etc.).

# Event Calendar
