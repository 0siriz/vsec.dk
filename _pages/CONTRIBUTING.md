# Website

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages making it easy to contribute to the site by making simple pull request to any page/post.  
All text on the site is written in markdown and generated into a static site by [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).  
Nameservers are currently being handle by gratisdns.dk with simple A and TXT/SPF records.  

Stylesheets are all stored in the `/styles` directory.
The styles are based on [Primer](https://github.com/primer/primer-css), the CSS toolkit that powers GitHub's front-end design.




If any of this information confusing, incorrect, or incomplete, feel free to reach out on discord or [open an issue](https://github.com/Viking-Security/website/issues/new) for help.
